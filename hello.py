    A reservoir properties calculator is an application that can be used to estimate various physical properties of hydrocarbon reservoirs such as oil, gas, and water. This type of application typically takes input data such as reservoir pressure, temperature, and fluid composition, and then uses mathematical models and empirical correlations to calculate properties such as reservoir fluid densities, viscosities, and phase behavior.
